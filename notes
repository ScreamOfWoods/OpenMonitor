Server monitoring software

The monitoring software should implement the following technologies:
1. Database where each server logs it's resources (CPU usage, RAM usage, Number of hosts etc.)
2. Small C++ program or Python script that tracks the servers resources and writes them in the database
3. Middle layer REST api which is used to get the display data from the database
4. Frontend which is used to display the various datasets to the user
4.1. The Frontend should be a single page application
4.2. There should be functionality to switch between monitoring different servers and all servers
4.2.1. Each server should report it's number of cpus, cpu cores, threads and clock, as well as the load averege
4.2.2. Each server should report it's memory usage
4.2.3. Each server should report number of running processes
4.2.4. Each server should report it's top 5 most cpu hungry and top 5 most memory hungry processes (cmdline)
